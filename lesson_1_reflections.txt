How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It made it easier to zone in on the differences in the files I was working on.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It makes it easier to learn from my mistakes in the past.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
 vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

*Pros
	Ability to assign meaning to each commit
*Cons
	More information than needed would be saved
	Some saves may not be useful



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
 while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 Git allows multiple files in one commit since one logical change can have an effect in multiple files
 Others like Google Docs allow lesser freedoms when saving thus they treat each file uniquely.


 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

 Using git log one can see all the commits ever done
 Using git diff one can see the differences between commits


 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It makes one confident by giving one the ability to move back and forth in between changes in case mistakes were made


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For version control!
